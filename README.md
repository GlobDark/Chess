# Chess in Java

## Introduction

 The classic board game created in the Java language. For 2 players (manual).

## Motivation

 They proposed that I implement a method in Java that, given the position of a knight on the board, would return the possible squares where it could move. I said to myself, why not do a complete chess? This was the result 3 days later.

## Installation

 Very simple to install (it is necessary to have Java installed on the computer)

1) Download the contents of the dist / folder and run the Chess.jar file

2) Download the project and run it in your IDE.

## Tests

Actually this project had very few hours of testing. However, after the completion of several games, all of them ended as expected without any problem that compromised the stability of the program.
